# Vehicle Insurance Customer Targeting

**Language:** R

**Platform:** R Studio

## Overview
In this project, we built a model to predict whether a customer from the past year would extend his or her vehicle insurance offered by this company, and figured out the most important features that drive the customer to extend the insurance, which are `Income`, `Renew Offer Type`, `Total Claim Amount` and `Customer Lifetime Value`. We recommended the insurance company to reach out the target customers with higher probability to extend the insurance and give different renew offer type to different customer.
